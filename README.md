# NMT

Implementing neural machine translation models for COMP 598 project  
The project is divided to two main phasess:  
Phase 1: Developing Word Embedding Models  
Phase 2: Developing Neural Machine Translation Models  

# Word Embedding

## Word2Vec
You can download the english text corpus from here: http://mattmahoney.net/dc/textdata  
Copy text8.txt to "dataset/" and run the "word2vec.ipynb" python notebook.  
Training logs for 100,200 and 300 vector sizes can be found in the project.  
Validation has been done for the word "eight" for these models.  
You can see the models that we have trained at "save/".  

# Neural Machine Translation
Develop neural machine translation models

## Part 1
Develop encoder-decoder LSTM

## Part 2
Develop Transformer model with attention
